<h2 align="center">Time to Configure!</h2>
<br>

Now that you understand how we've gotten to this point and our goal, you can now begin reading through this section to properly configure each option in your configuration property list.

As suggested earlier, we are using ``Sample.plist`` as the basis for our own configuration file. As such, we must ensure we understand all options, and have properly set them to their appropriate/intended value *before* you attempt booting, as currently, you technically do not have a configuration file intended for your system.

We will now begin by sanity checking our APCI dictionary.
