NVMe storage devices can sometimes require additional patches or kexts for full functionality, particularly when it comes to ensuring proper support for TRIM and enabling the drive to be recognized correctly by macOS.
# Recommended NVMes

| Drive Name | Notes |
| WD_BLACK SN750 | One of the best choices. |
| Western Digital SN700 | One of the best choices. |
| WD_BLACK SN850/SN850X| One of the best choices. |
