{: .important }
NVMe storage devices can sometimes require additional patches or kexts for full functionality, particularly when it comes to ensuring proper support for TRIM and enabling the drive to be recognized correctly by macOS.

{: .warning}
Many NVMe drives will require [NVMeFix.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/NVMeFix) to function properly.

# Recommended NVMes

| Drive Name | Notes |
| WD_BLACK SN750 | One of the best choices |
| Western Digital SN700 | One of the best choices |
| WD_BLACK SN850/SN850X| One of the best choices |

# Samsung

{: .important }
Many Samsung NVMe drives are known to cause issues, so it's best to avoid using them if possible. If you already have an Samsung NVMe, it's best to use it as an storage-only drive. You shouldn't install macOS on it.

| Drive Name | Notes |
| Samsung 950 Pro | Should be used as an storage-only NVMe |
| Samsung 960 Evo/Pro | Should be used as an storage-only NVMe |
| Samsung 970 Evo/Pro | Samsung released an firmware update that should make this NVMe work with macOS |
| Samsung 980 Pro | Should be used as an storage-only NVMe |

# Western Digital

{: .important }
The situation is quite different with WD drives â€” almost anything from WD will work.

| Drive Name | Notes |
| WD Blue SN550 | Should work without any problems |
| WD Black SN700 | Should work without any problems |
| WD Black SN720 | Should work without any problems |
| WD Black SN750 | Should work without any problems |
| WD Black SN850 | Should work without any problems |
