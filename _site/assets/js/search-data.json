If you'd like an answer right now, the best and most straight forward answer is that the Mac operating system is nothing inherently special from other operating systems, but it is incredibly picky, limited in support for hardware, and was never meant to run on your computer. We take advantage of an amazing bootloader known as OpenCore to properly patch our system to present it to OS X / macOS in a way it can understand. Everyone's hardware is unique. You must take the time and effort to properly configure OpenCore for your system to boot the Mac operating system in it's purest, vanilla form. ",

We go to explaining the other children first. | Key | Type | Value | . | ForceDisplayRotationInEFI | Number | 0 | . | SystemAudioVolume | Data | &lt;&gt; | . ForceDisplayRotationInEFI is a 32-bit integer defining display rotation. Can be 0 for no rotation or any of 90, 180, 270 for matching rotation in degrees. SystemAudioVolume is a data key that takes an 8-bit unsigned integer. The bit of 0x80 means muted. The remaining bits are used to encode the raw amplifier gain setting to be applied to the audio amplifier in use. Exactly what this value means depends on the codec (and potentially on the specific amplifier within the codec). This value is capped by macOS to the MaximumBootBeepVolume AppleHDA layout value, to avoid over-loud audio playback in the firmware. | Key | Type | Value | . | boot-args | String | -v keepsyms=1 | .

It’s invaluable to any Hackintosher, as it gives you an inside look at the boot process, and can help you identify issues, problem kexts, etc. | . | keepsyms=1 | This is a companion setting to debug=0x100 that tells the OS to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give some more helpful insight as to what’s causing the panic itself. | . | debug=0x100 | This disables macOS’s watchdog which helps prevents a reboot on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the issues. | . GPU Related Boot Args . The following boot-args are Lilu boot args!

ClearScreenOnModeSwitch useful when some types of firmware only clear part of the screen when switching from graphics to text mode, leaving a fragment of previously drawn images visible. This option fills the entire graphics screen with black colour before switching to text mode. ConsoleFont specifies the console font to use for OpenCore Builtin text renderer. The font file must be located in EFI/OC/Resources/Font/ and be 8x16 resolution. Various console fonts can be found online in either .bdf or .hex format. While .bdf can be converted to .hex format using gbdfed (available for Linux or macOS). ConsoleMode sets console output mode as specified with the WxH (e.g. 80x24) formatted string. DirectGopRendering Boolean dictates usage for builtin graphics output protocol renderer for console. On certain firmware, such as on the MacPro5,1 this may provide better performance or fix rendering issues. ForceResolution Forces Resolution to be set in cases where the desired resolution is not available by default, such as on legacy Intel GMA and first generation Intel HD Graphics (Ironlake/Arrandale). Setting Resolution to Max will try to pull the largest available resolution from the connected display’s EDID. GopBurstMode enables write-combining (WC) caching for GOP memory, if system firmware has not already enabled it. GopPassThrough provides GOP protocol instances on top of UGA protocol instances. IgnoreTextInGraphics for some types of firmware output text onscreen in both graphics and text mode. This is typically unexpected as random text may appear over graphical images and cause UI corruption. Setting this option to true will discard all text output if console control is not in Text mode. InitialMode selects the internal ConsoleControl mode in which TextRenderer will operate. ProvideConsoleGop ensures GOP (Graphics Output Protocol) on console handle. macOS bootloader requires GOP or UGA (for 10.4 EfiBoot) to be present on console handle, yet the exact location of the graphics protocol is not covered by the UEFI specification. This option will ensure GOP and UGA, if present, are available on the console handle. ReconnectGraphicsOnConnect reconnects all graphics drivers during driver connection. ReconnectOnResChange reconnects console controllers after changing screen resolution. ReplaceTabWithSpace is a boolean for types of firmware that do not print tab characters or everything that follows them, causing difficulties in using the UEFI Shell’s builtin text editor to edit property lists and other documents. This option makes the console output spaces instead of tabs. Resolution sets console output screen resolution. Set to WxH@Bpp (e.g. 1920x1080@32) or WxH (e.g. 1920x1080) formatted string to request custom resolution from GOP if available. SanitiseClearScreen for some types of firmware that reset screen resolutions to a failsafe value (such as 1024x768) on the attempts to clear screen contents when large display (e.g. 2K or 4K) is used. This option attempts to apply a workaround. TextRenderer chooses renderer for text going through standard console output. Currently two renderers are supported: Builtin and System.

    "content": "Apply individual firmware quirks described in the Quirks Properties section below. Relating to quirks with the UEFI environment. | Key | Type | Value | . | ActivateHpetSupport | Boolean | False | . | DisableSecurityPolicy | Boolean | False | . | EnableVectorAcceleration | Boolean | False | . | EnableVmx | Boolean | False | . | ExitBootServicesDelay | Number | 0 | . | ForceOcWriteFlash | Boolean | False | . | ForgeUefiSupport | Boolean | False | . | IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio | Boolean | False | . | ReleaseUsbOwnership | Boolean | False | . | ReloadOptionRoms | Boolean | False | . | RequestBootVarRouting | Boolean | False | . | ResizeGpuBars | Number | 0 | . | ResizeUsePciRbIo | Boolean | False | . | ShimRetainProtocol | Boolean | False | . | TscSyncTimeout | Number | 0 | . | UnblockFsConnect | Boolean | 0 | . ActivateHpetSupport activates HPET support. Older boards like ICH6 may not always have HPET setting in the firmware preferences, this option tries to force enable it. DisableSecurityPolicy disables platform security policy. Note: This setting disables various security features of the firmware, defeating the purpose of any kind of Secure Boot. Do NOT enable if using UEFI Secure Boot. EnableVectorAcceleration enables AVX vector acceleration of SHA-512 and SHA-384 hashing algorithms. Note: This option may cause issues on certain laptop firmwares, including Lenovo. EnableVmx enables Intel virtual machine extensions. Required to allow virtualization in Windows on some Mac hardware. VMX is enabled or disabled and locked by BIOS before OpenCore starts on most firmware. Use BIOS to enable virtualization where possible. ExitBootServicesDelay adds delay in microseconds after EXIT_BOOT_SERVICES event. ForceOcWriteFlash enables writing to flash memory for all OpenCore-managed NVRAM system variables . ForgeUefiSupport implements partial UEFI 2.x support on EFI 1.x firmware. This setting allows running some software written for UEFI 2.x firmware, such as NVIDIA GOP Option ROMs, on hardware with older EFI 1.x firmware (e.g. MacPro5,1). IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio Some types of firmware (such as APTIO IV) may contain invalid values in the MSR_FLEX_RATIO (0x194) MSR register. These values may cause macOS boot failures on Intel platforms. Note: While the option is not expected to harm unaffected firmware, its use is recommended only when specifically required. ReleaseUsbOwnership attempts to detach USB controller ownership from the firmware driver. While most types of firmware manage to do this properly, or at least have an option for this, some do not. As a result, the operating system may freeze upon boot. Not recommended unless specifically required. ReloadOptionRoms enables query of PCI devices and reload their Option ROMs if available. For example, this option allows reloading NVIDIA GOP Option ROM on older Macs after the firmware version is upgraded via ForgeUefiSupport. RequestBootVarRouting requests redirect of all Boot prefixed variables from EFI_GLOBAL_VARIABLE_GUID to OC_VENDOR_VARIABLE_GUID. ResizeGpuBars configures GPU PCI BAR sizes. This quirk sets GPU PCI BAR sizes as specified or chooses the largest available below the ResizeGpuBars value. The specified value follows PCI Resizable BAR spec. Use 0 for 1 MB, 1 for 2 MB, 2 for 4 MB, and so on up to 19 for 512 GB. ResizeUsePciRbIo uses PciRootBridgeIo for ResizeGpuBars and ResizeAppleGpuBars. ShimRetainProtocol requests Linux Shim to keep protocol installed for subsequent image loads. TscSyncTimeout attempts to perform TSC synchronisation with a specified timeout. UnblockFsConnect can be used on some types of firmware that block partition handles by opening them in By Driver mode, resulting in an inability to install File System protocols. Note: This quirk is useful in cases where unsuccessful drive detection results in an absence of boot entries. Placeholder text telling user what options are needed, and why. Delete those which are not required. ",

The Mac operating system was only ever intended to run on a specific set of hardware put together by Apple. This means that for our purposes—running it on non-Apple hardware—the responsibility of correcting how we present our hardware to macOS / OS X, depending on our level of compatibility, falls on us. Before we even consider proceeding with the decision to run the Mac operating system on your intended target hardware, we must thoroughly understand all its individual components, especially if it is a pre-built machine or a laptop. After we run through various related topics, we can then verify the viability of your hardware using the support charts. ",

    "title": "What is OpenCore? How can we use it?",
    "content": ". OpenCore is known as a custom bootloader that has the unique ability to see, and boot HFS+ and APFS disks and disk images. In the world of UEFI firmware, you can run what are essentially binaries such as bootloaders you’re familiar with, like GRUB or the Windows Boot Manager. OpenCore unlike other bootloaders, has to be manually configured to properly boot the Mac operating system. This is where you are able to use OpenCore to your advantage. Issues you are aware of, can be fixed with enough persistence and proper configuration. As .efi files are simply bootable by most UEFI firmwares via a USB, we can use a flash drive to configure OpenCore until we are satisfied it is as complete as it can be. This allows us to quickly modify config.plist and reboot to quickly prototype these changes. Later, during Post Installation, when we are satisfied with our results of our EFI you can install it to the usual EFI partition that exists on your disk. This removes the necessity to use a USB to boot OS X / macOS. To continue in this guide you will require: . | USB Flash Drive (4GB+) | 10GB Free Space on Disk | . Begin by formatting your USB to FAT32, when you are ready please continue. ",

Upon launching it, we are greeted with an interface that should look similar to the screenshot below. The program provides us with various options and may not be exact to the image below if changes are made to SSDTTime. In order to create SSDTs, SSDTTime requires us to provide ACPI tables found in our firmware, for it to create the final resulting .aml files. Selecting the option named Dump the current system's ACPI tables, you will automatically have SSDTTime attempt to dump the current machines ACPI/DSDT. Afterwards, it should now be loaded and you can begin generating specific SSDT’s for your system. From the descriptions below, you will be able to determine what options you will require to boot your system, according to your previous look into your hardware’s support and requirements.

This stick must be formatted to FAT32 - the size doesn’t matter. We want to create a folder called EFI in the root directory of the stick. Then, create a subfolder called BOOT. In this subfolder, we paste Shell.efi and rename it to Bootx64.efi. We then also paste ACPIDump.efi - this file doesn’t have to be renamed. As a result, our stick should have the following structure: . Bootx64.efi is not the same file as the one provided inside OpenCorePkg! Do NOT confuse them. An EFI is simply a bootable UEFI executable, and this is how to quickly prepare a USB with the UEFI Shell and ACPIDump.efi binary program to execute in the Shell environment. We then need to reboot to boot this stick. You are dropped into the UEFI Shell, we must enter: . ACPIDump.efi -b -n . This should create a bunch of files inside the root directory of the stick that we can now access for SSDTTime. After we’ve dumped our tables, we wont need the stick anymore.

    "content": "A kext is short for kernel extension. These extensions make it possible to extend the functionality of the operating system without having to recompile the kernel itself. Kexts are similar to drivers in Windows because they allow the kernel to communicate with the computer’s hardware and are often used to add support for new hardware or improve existing hardware features. Kext files are actually bundles that contain multiple files, similar to ZIP archives, but are not compressed - that’s why they appear as folders in Windows or Linux. In OS X / macOS, you can view the contents of a kext file by right-clicking it and selecting “Show Package Contents”, in other OS, you can simply treat them like folders. However, Apple has started to reduce the use of kexts, especially since macOS Big Sur, as they can cause security issues. For us, they are essential to get OS X / macOS running. We want to make sure we’re always grabbing the most minimal amount of kexts for our purposes of booting recoveryOS as a sanity check. You’ll find you will always need the following: . | Lilu | . It is the patching engine that most basic kexts will use. From the charts below, you will be able to determine what else you will require to boot your system.

    "content": "Acidanthera’s VirtualSMC emulates Apple’s SMC found on real Macs inside the kernel. It is essential for running macOS on non-native hardware. VirtualSMC is the basis for other kexts, some of which have to be downloaded separately. VirtualSMC comes bundled with several plugins, which are listed below. VirtualSMC supports all macOS versions (OS X 10.4 Tiger to macOS 15 Sequoia). | SMCBatteryManager . SMCBatteryManager is a VirtualSMC plugin that provides detailed battery information, including the current percentage. As the name suggests, it requires you to have a battery, therefore you shouldn’t use it on Desktops. SMCBatteryManager supports all macOS versions (OS X 10.4 Tiger to macOS 15 Sequoia). | SMCDellSensors . SMCDellSensors is a plugin for VirtualSMC. This plugin is specifically designed to support Dell laptops and desktops by providing sensor data to macOS. As the name suggests, it requires you to have a system manufactured by Dell. Don’t use it if you don’t have a Dell machine. SMCDellSensors supports OS X 10.7 Lion to macOS 15 Sequoia. | SMCLightSensor . SMCLightSensor is a plugin for VirtualSMC. This plugin is specifically designed to provide ambient light sensor data to macOS, allowing the system to adjust screen brightness and other settings based on the surrounding light conditions. This kext requires a light sensor, which is typically found only in higher-end laptops. If your laptop doesn’t support automatic brightness adjustment in Windows, this kext won’t function. When in doubt, it’s best to skip it. SMCLightSensor supports OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard to macOS 15 Sequoia. | SMCProcessor . SMCProcessor is a VirtualSMC plugin used to read CPU temperature on Intel based systems (Penryn and newer). SMCProcessor supports OS X 10.7 Lion to macOS 15 Sequoia. | SMCSuperIO . SMCSuperIO is a VirtualSMC plugin that can read and edit fan speeds. It may require additional patching. SMCLightSensor supports OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard to macOS 15 Sequoia. | . SMCAMDProcessor &amp; AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement . SMCAMDProcessor is the counterpart to SMCProcessor that comes bundled with AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement. AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement (that is actually not a VirtualSMC plugin) provides power management features for AMD Processors. SMCAMDProcessor is a VirtualSMC plugin that collects sensor data - however, you can’t use it without AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement. In addition, these kexts allow PState editing and manual switching of clock speeds inside the bundled AMD Power Gadget tool. Note that SMCAMDProcessor &amp; AMDRyzenCPUPowermanagement don’t work as intended on AMD based laptops. Using these kexts may result in increased temperatures and reduced battery life. In theory, SMCAMDProcessor and AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement support OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion up to macOS 15 Sequoia. However, AMD support (without a lot of patching) is only available in macOS 10.13 High Sierra to macOS 15 Sequoia. SMCProcessorAMD . SMCProcessorAMD is very similar to SMCAMDProcessor. The key difference is that SMCAMDProcessor is dependent on AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement - if you don’t want to use AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement for some reason (e.g. you own a laptop), you can use SMCProcessorAMD. SMCProcessorAMD supports OS X 10.7 Mountain Lion up to macOS 15 Sequoia. However, AMD support (without a lot of patching) is only available in macOS 10.13 High Sierra to macOS 15 Sequoia. AsusSMC . AsusSMC is a VirtualSMC plugin that provides support for built-in Ambient Light Sensors (ALS), keyboard backlight control, battery sensors and Fn key support on Asus laptops. As the name suggests, this only applies to Asus laptops. In theory, AsusSMC supports OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion up to macOS 15 Sequoia. YogaSMC . Just as AsusSMC, YogaSMC is a VirtualSMC plugin that provides sensor readings to the SMC. As the name suggests, this only applies to Lenovo laptops. Make sure to read the readMe if you have such a Lenovo laptop. It is not known to us which versions YogaSMC supports. Please let us know which ones are possible. BigSurface . BigSurface is, among other things, a VirtualSMC plugin that provides sensor data to the SMC on certain Surface devices. Read the ReadMe if you have a Microsoft device. In theory, BigSurface supports macOS 10.12 Sierra up to macOS 15 Sequoia. SMCRadeonSensors . SMCRadeonSensors is a VirtualSMC plugin that provides temperature readings on AMD GPUs. SMCRadeonSensors supports macOS 10.14 Mojave up to macOS 15 Sequoia. ",

Again, choose the right one for your OS. Once we have started gibMacRecovery, we should see the following menu: . First, we want to choose option 1) to download the recovery catalog. Afterwards, we want to choose option 2). Here we can select a macOS version to choose from. Its not possible to install OS X 10.4 Tiger to OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard using gibMacRecovery. We now select the recovery environment for the operating system we want to install. After that, we return to the menu and finally select option 7) to download the recovery. Once we finished downloading, we can close the program. We should now find a new folder in our Mac Recovery directory. Depending on the target version, the folder contains a large file called BaseSystem.dmg or RecoveryImage.dmg and a small associated chunklist. We want to place the folder with the containing files in the root directory of our installation media, just next to our EFI folder. If everything worked, we can continue. ",

AMDVanillaPatches allows us to merge the required kernel patches with less manual editing. It’s pretty self-explanatory. However, you should read the README of the AMD Vanilla Patches to understand what is actually happening. First of all, we have to get the tool itself. We can simply download the main branch or clone the repository via CLI. Once we have the repository (you may need to unzip it), we should see the following files. You can now choose the appropriate script depending on your platform (Windows users should choose the .bat file). We should now be greeted something like this. First we want to select option 1). We then choose option 2) and drag and drop our config.plist into it. We then confirm it with enter. After that we choose option 3) - Here we have to enter the number of CPU cores of our target system (NOT threads). Now we can close the program and continue with the platform-specific configuration.

Other reasons to not use a configurator include: No Kext ordering logic based on dependencies of Kexts, Auto-saving changes without warning (especially damaging changes), Zero’ing out Data that is valid for OpenCore, but invalid by the configurators PLIST parser library, so its deemed to become “0”, deleting important data such as AppleECID. Due to a bug with Xcode’s plist editor that randomly trims your plist, along with incompatibilities with OpenCore’s PLIST formatting it is not recommended for usage. Before we dive into configuring OpenCore, we should clarify a few things. The .plist file format is an Apple crafted XML-type document. In theory, you can use any program you can edit plain text with, but if you don’t want to waste years in Microsoft Word, Nano or TextEdit, it is advisable to use a adequate plist editor that properly reads the XML tags and displays them in a properly human-editable format. It’s recommended to use CorpNewt’s ProperTree for various reasons. ProperTree is a versatile, cross-platform PLIST editor that works across Python versions. Since it’s built with Python, it can theoretically run on any system that supports Python 2 or newer. One of its standout features is the array of built-in functions specifically designed for OpenCore, making it highly convenient. ",

OpenCore is NOT aware of the files in your EFI, the config plist is what tells OC what is what, and where is what, and whether or not to load it. Snapshotting explained in deep detail . OC Snapshot . Updates the current values in ACPI -&gt; Add, Kernel -&gt; Add, Misc -&gt; Tools, and UEFI -&gt; Drivers by only adding or removing entries as needed. OC Clean Snapshot . Clears these four sections completely and adds all entries from scratch. Both functions update various sections, but OC Snapshot keeps your custom settings for existing entries like Enabled, MinKernel, MaxKernel, and Comments. CorpNewt’s OCSnapshot CLI tool is able to transfer the structure of your EFI folder into your config.plist. The OCSnapshot function is already integrated in ProperTree. All you have to do is ensure you’re focused on ProperTree, and press Ctrl+R (or Cmd+R) and select the OC folder. However, when you take a snapshot for the first time, it is highly recommended to take a so-called Clean Snapshot. To do this, press Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R and select the OC folder. At this point in the Docs, you should now do an Clean OC Snapshot, to initialize your plists content. When you are ready to continue, please select your CPU Brand below. ",
