<p align="center">For the next two pages you will learn what it takes to properly determine if the hardware you have is not only able to run OS X / macOS in the first place, but meets the minimum requirements to have a usable system. This includes requirements like having a natively supported Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in your system of choice, not just a supported CPU. There are other overlooked requirements such as supported hardware for Networking. You will not be able to install the OS X / macOS operating system via Base System / recoveryOS without an active working internet connection. Other potential roadblocks for an enjoyable experience can be a result of, but are not limited to:</p>
<br>

- No supported Sound hardware

- No supported, or Semi-Supported Storage hardware

- Wi-Fi is not supported, but cannot use Ethernet either

- Missing required CPU instructions to run newer macOS releases (Ventura / 13+)

- The hardware combination of a Laptop

- The hardware combination of a prebuilt PC

- UEFI/BIOS firmware (and updates) that cause ACPI issues.

<p align="center">When it comes to talking about the future of macOS's support for x86 / x86_64, we need to consider what it means for you, if you find out that you do not have supported hardware, but are willing to purchase supported hardware for your system for missing features or overall support.</p>

<p align="center">This is an important topic to be knowledgeable on because:</p>
<br>

- Do you know what it means for you when the next release of macOS is not supported on Intel-based Macs? Will this happen sooner, rather than later?

- Have you ever owned a Mac machine and have experienced the inability to upgrade to XYZ version? If so, you're actually able to already understand what will happen.

<br>
<p align="center">A deep dive into making good purchases and financial decisions when it comes to your want (not need) of running macOS can potentially be done without purchasing the newest, most expensive, hardware available annd sometimes you can get away with cheaper alternatives if your use-case does not require more. For now, let's set our expectations for the information here.</p>
